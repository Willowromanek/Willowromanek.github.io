                <p>Does anyone do a Halloween episode better than The Vampire Diaries? Though the stakes were always high on this show, "Haunted" marked the first time that a major character bit the dust, showing just how easily any of our favorite teens could be killed off. As the troubled one of the group, Vicki (Kayla Ewell) was an easy target for Damon, who caused her human death, but no one could have predicted that she would be turned into a vampire and then mercilessly staked by Stefan all in the same day. RIP Vicki!</p>

                        <p>Vampire Diaries was already firing on all cylinders by the time it reached the twisty Season 1 finale, which saw Mayor Lockwood (Robert Pralgo) die, Tyler (Michael Trevino) learn that he's a supernatural being thanks to that pesky Gilbert device, and both Stefan and Damon nearly scorched to death in a basement fire. What really set this gripping hour apart from the rest, though, was that unforgettable cliffhanger in which Katherine, pretending to be Elena, stabbed John Gilbert (David Anders) before an unsuspecting Elena entered the house. It was the first time we got to see how ruthless and diabolical Katherine could be and that deliciously gory moment when she chopped off John's fingers is forever imprinted in our brains.</p>

In this episode, we got to see Katherine, Damon, and Stefan locked in a room together, forced to hash out their sordid histories at long last. In the end, Stefan and Damon might have pulled one over on Katherine by locking her in the tomb, but it turned out that would be just one victory in a series of skirmishes they would have with her over the years.</p>

The entire season had been building up the sacrificial ritual, which lived up to the hype as the temperamental original hybrid picked off his three "goddesses" -- Elena, Jenna (Sara Canning), and Jules (Michaela McManus) -- one by one. The episode, which broke our hearts with Jenna's tragic death, proved the series wasn't afraid to venture into bold, new directions.</p>

Elena shared a kiss with Damon just as Katherine arrived with the cure, setting up major plot threads for season 3. Elsewhere, Jeremy was shot and resurrected by Bonnie, but it had a side effect causing him to see his dead ex-girlfriends. A lot was going on in this episode that set the tone for a strong follow-up season.</p>

A deeply haunting hour that saw Elena contemplate a simpler time before those hunky Salvatore brothers upended her life, the episode delivered one of the most gut-wrenching deaths of the series when Alaric died in Damon's arms at the same time that Elena drowned after forcing Stefan to save Matt instead.</p>

At the end of this episode, a heartbreaking scene between Damon and Elena occurs leaving the fans in tears.</p>

It perfectly balanced resolving every character's major storylines while delivering several goodbyes that brought us to tears. "I Was Feeling Epic" celebrated where these characters had been and more importantly where they were all going, regardless of who lived and who died when all was said and done. It was, for lack of a better word, epic.</p>
