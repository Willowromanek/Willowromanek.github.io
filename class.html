                    <p>
                      BASED ON ROTTEN TOMATOES AND CRITICS: <br><br>
            SEASON 1: 73%- It's not particularly innovative and there's a lot of angsty brooding going on, but there's a self-referential cheekiness in The Vampire Diaries that will appeal directly to its target audience.<br><br>
                  <b>   SEASON 2: 100%- </b> The sophomore season of Vampire Diaries is top shelf guilty pleasure, balancing wild twists and cliffhangers without going off the rails. <br><br>
                  <b>   SEASON 3: 90%- </b> A bloody delight, The Vampire Diaries continues its winning run with its trademark twists, shocking deaths, and consistent character development.<br> <br>
                  <b>   SEASON 4: 69%- </b> Vampire Diaries gets the best out of star Nina Dobrev, but could use some fresh blood on the page as plotlines struggle to move the series forward.<br>  <br>
                  <b>   SEASON 5: 100%- </b>After a floundering fourth season, Vampire Diaries redeems itself with scorching twists that remind viewers that nothing is sacred. <br> <br>
                  <b>   SEASON 6: 81%- </b>The sixth season of The Vampire Diaries attempts to give Elena the fondest farewell amid the murderous melodrama. <br> <br>
                  <b>   SEASON 7: 77%- </b> Despite an Elena-less season, Vampire Diaries still has plenty of fleshed out plot and new characters for fans to sink their teeth into.<br> <br>
                  <b> SEASON 8: 100%- </b> Even into its eighth season, The Vampire Diaries exceeds genre expectations while still servicing fans with Nina Dobrev's return.

        <p> <h5>By Tarun Varma</h5> Wow....wow....wow...TVD is by far one of the best TV series ever. This is just amazing and it contains literally everything starting from love, family, friendship, high school drama, emotions, twists and so on. It consists of 8 seasons, though it is lengthy u will never feel bored. Almost every episode ends with a twist and builds up curiosity to watch the next episode. The characters, mainly Stefan Salvatore (played by Paul Wesley), Damon Salvatore (played by Ian Somerhalder), Elena Gilbert (played by Nina Dobrev), Caroline Forbes (played by Candice King), Bonnie Bennett (played by Kat Graham) were simply superb and the roles were apt to them as we feel connected. The brotherly bond, emotional connection between Stefan and Damon, like how they sacrifice everything for each other was astonishing. Though Damon says he will torture his brother initially (due to what happened in the past between them), we see how much he changes after he falls in love with Elena. Nina Dobrev was just perfect as she showed a great variation between the roles (Elena and Katherine). The love story between Stefan and Elena, Stefan and Caroline at the end, Damon and Elena was portrayed in a beautiful manner. U can't really hate any character in this show, but I felt Stefan and Damon were the best. Stefan, the way he controls his urge to kill, his kindness, never forces his decision on others, wanted his brother to change, sacrifice at the end was excellent. Coming to Damon, his attitude, sarcasm, humor was top notch. U even get glimpses of Klaus and Elijah of what they are (The Original Vampires) in this show. Though Elena was missed in the last 2 seasons, it gave us scope for more characters and even increased the bond between the brothers. I felt Bonnie deserved more at the end, as she was left with nothing even though she fought for her friends and sacrificed her life every time. Enzo (Bonnie and Enzo loved each other) was killed, Tyler was killed at the end which was not expected and bit disappointing.
Final Verdict : If u are into watching supernatural stuff, The Vampire Diaries is really worth watching and u will love it!!!!<br><br>
<h5>By Kirtika Teotia</h5>I had started watching tvd a lil bit late as i have heard abt it being one of the best vampire television show so I can't resist myself. Actually it has everything that a viewer need to see to watch a show(trust me you'll love it), I'm
personally a fan of damon(ian somerhalder),stefan(paul Wesley), Caroline (candice king) as they're (including all cast)just perfect & appropriate for the series and the guys are like really hotüî• .The show teaches us soo many incredible things in  real life being a fictional show.
Each and every character on the show (bonnie,elena,alaric,stefan,damon,Caroline,tyler,klaus,rebekah etc) had done a great job with their part, eventually you'll just fall in love with them.It's one of the bestest tv show ‚ù§Ô∏èthat i had ever watched.Above all, Damon's humour is otp  in each and every season.All the characters had an amazing growth till the end.<br><br>
<h5>By Kanmani Sakthivel</h5>OMG! i just can't believe I finished watching TVD . This show is just more than amazinggg. I literally felt every emotion while watching this show. Idk where to start with but let me say that I'm astounded by nina dobrev,ian somerhalder and paul wesley , THEIR ACTING WAS ON POINT. I loved their love triangle and the way they portrayed themselves was so real to watch. Although there are a lot of characters  ,you get to analyse,understand and love each one of them .
Starting with ,
damon,stefan,elena,katherine,caroline,bonnie,matt,tyler,alaric,klaus,
elijah,kai,jo,enzo ,jeremy,valerie.... all of them has won my heart someway or the other.Finally i have to say that i'm so obsessed with this show and it will always be one of my fav supernatural series. I wonder how talented tvd casts were to play their roles so perfect ,that no one ever can replace their own roles except for themselves , I appreciate all the effort and hard work the directors ,producers and all the off screen people have put on to make this series , AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE THE AMAZING SHOW EVER !<br><br>

<h5> By Aditi Aggarwal</h5> I love it sooooooo much. Its absolutely amazing. It contains everything a viewer needs which probably is love, family, friendships, enmity and that juicy drama... I used to stay up alll night sometimes even till 6 am in the morning just because i couldn't stop clicking on the next episode. Damon Salvatore, Elena Gilbert, Bonnie bennet, Katherine Peirce, Stefan Salvatore, Klaus mikaelson, Alaric saltzman, Enzo st. John and etc are just characters but they have connected in a certain way with us Tvdians over the past years that we developed love for them, soooo much love.. every single character teaches us something... Stefan showed that you should keep on fighting even though if the other option might be easier....( He fought the craving for blood ) Damon showed that even if you have done horrible things in the past, there is time for you to change and love might do that...( He killed so many people but he changed for good when he fell in love with elena ) Bonnie did everything she could for love..( she lost her gramz, enzo, jeremy, her mom and much more but she still fought for the people she loved ) Elena showed us that we can't be sad forever ( her parents died and she said she was dead inside ) and so on.. Everything about this show is amazing. Us Tvdians have developed soooo much love that everytime we see the last episode or  elena's breakdown or Caroline grieving over liz's death, we sob sooooo much. Bonnie, elena and caroline's friendship... Damon and stefan's brotherhood... And etc, everything is just perfect. Props to Ian Somerhalder, Paul Wesley, Nina Dobrev and Kat graham for their OUTSTANDING acting. The cast of the show is just perfect. Nobody could have portrayed the characters stefan damon and elena or Katherine better... I mean we got so used to the show that we can recognise the difference in Katherine and elena in seconds... Nina Dobrev did such a good job. NOBODY could have done damon better.  And i cried everytime stefan cried... Paul Wesley did an excellent job with Stefan. This show is just perfect  i love it soooooooooo damn much. Hey and plus point, the song choice is INCREDIBLE.

              <p><h5> By Adnan Ferdous Leo </h5> This is one of the few Vampire Shows available that is so riveting to watch . Although the writing is a bit shallow , the story is good enough to keep your interest in the show piqued . The most strong points of this show are its characters , their relationships and role in the show as a whole . Every character is unique with their charm and personality and each and every one of them has a highlighted feature in the plotline . Even some villains are so good that you are gonna empathize for them . Well there are violence in the show but they are cleverly portrayed by smart camera angle without being disturbing .

Trust me if you start watching this show , it will be hard for you to stop binging until the end of the final episode.<br><br>
<h5> By Sumit Paryani</h5> Vampire diaries is interesting dama which will take you the world of vampires who are fighting and loving at the same time with humans. It is a perfect love, horror, suspenseful thriller story which will grip you at every episode. No doubt All actors did best shot in the series and you will love their way of story telling. IT'S must watch for everyone who is looking for some good series, but makers did very extra work to stretch out series which could be done in shorter time frame.
ONE WORD: Excellent
8/10</P>
            <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">3 STARS</h4>
          <p><h5> By Bhumika Nayak</h5> Filled with drama, thrill, romance in the fantasy world of vampires , witches and werewolves. It's a teen-mystery show, not the best of the lot but definitely the best of it's kind ( vampires and what not)I loved this show when I first saw it... I watched it with great enthusiasm till about season 5...then it got a little boring and repetitive according to me. The initial seasons are great!! I absolutely loved them. Ian somherhalder, nina dobrev, Paul Wesley, are so good in their roles. Damon is my favorite. I recommend you watch this show if you like extensively drama packed shows.... <br><br>
      <h5> Nikki Godwin </h5>   I just watched the show and even though I enjoyed watching I am terribly disappointed in how the story line was terrible for Bonnie. Bonnie risked her life time and time again for her friends and the min she gets a story line about her happiness and love you rip it away from him. The writers showed that her friends didn't care about her pain. It was swepped under the rug and it became all about the other story lines. Bonnie was truly happy and in love with Enzo and you killed him off the show. The story line and writers only was concerned about Caroline and Elena's happy. Again last not forget Bonnie was a main character and gave her life over and over, she even became the portal so your main characters could live.</P>
            <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">2 STARS</h4>
          <p><h5> By David Krischke</h5> This show starts off pretty strong and entertaining, but season by season the characters get more and more pathetic. By season 4 everyone is wining constantly and turns pathetically useless at every crucial moment. I get the need for a continuing plot but wow... Come on..</P>
            <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">1 STARS</h4>
          <p><h5> By Cole Warner</h5>This tv show is terrible and very overrated, The first few minutes of set up mystery aspect was interesting, but the love story is trash, and the interesting murder mystery aspect was also ruined by wooden acting, bad characters, and terrible humor. It is just werewolf humping vampires that is very uncomfortable to watch and this show has nothing else good about it other than the cinematography, and murder mystery aspect. I don't understand why so much people love this show and i would never recommend it.
</P>
