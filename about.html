                <p>In the story of multiple lives, loves, dangers and disasters in the town, Mystic Falls, Virginia. Where creatures of unspeakable horror lurk beneath this town and a teenage girl is suddenly torn between two vampire brothers, the cast is what brings it to life. The cast may have gone their separate ways after the final episode aired, but they've stayed in touch over the years! In fact, in May 2021, Paul and Ian teamed up for an interview to promote their new company, Brother's Bond, and spilled some major Vampire Diaries secrets.
               </p>
 <h3 class="display-4 font-weight-bold mb-4"> Main Characters </h3>
          <p     <b> Damon Salvatore played by Ian Somerholder, </b> is one of the two main male protagonists of The Vampire Diaries. Damon was a 178-year-old vampire and distant descendant of Silas. Since his younger brother, Stefan Salvatore, injected him with the Cure, he is now human. He was a major antagonist in the first part of Season One. He was born in 1839 and lived in the colonial town of Mystic Falls with his brother Stefan, his father, Giuseppe Salvatore, and also with his mother Lillian Salvatore until her death in 1858. He became a vampire in 1864. At the time of his return to Mystic Falls, Damon and Stefan hadn't seen each other in fifteen years due to their bitter and violent relationship.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>  Stefan Salvatore played by Paul Wesley,</b> was one of the two main male protagonists of The Vampire Diaries. Stefan was a 171-year-old cured vampire and the distant descendant and doppelgänger of Silas. Stefan was born and raised in the supernatural town of Mystic Falls, Virginia and came of age during the time of the Civil War. Stefan was the youngest child of Giuseppe Salvatore and Lillian Salvatore. He had an older brother, Damon Salvatore, who is also a cured vampire and whom he shared a strained relationship with, stemming from the appearance of Katherine Pierce over whom they fought whilst human.
   </p>
    <p>
    <b>  Elena Gilbert played by Nina Dobrev</b> was the former main female protagonist of The Vampire Diaries.
