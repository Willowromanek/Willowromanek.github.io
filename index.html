                      If you have not already watched The Vampire Diaries, you are missing out. Let’s face it, saying you genuinely enjoy a show called The Vampire Diaries can be a bit embarrassing but it truly is one of the most entertaining shows on television because it has everything you need in a good series. It is one of the most popular shows in CW history as it ran for eight seasons, had multiple spin-offs, it sparked many careers for successful actors, and people still talk about it now, and. The devoted audience of the show were devastated when it ended because all of us wanted to stay in the fantastical world that was created. I know I am not the only person who has watched all eight seasons of The Vampire Diaries five times and not gotten bored. Evidently, I believe no other show could ever compare to it, so, here's why.
 In all seasons there is  drama, romance, thrill, fantasy and the plot always has  an element of surprise. Every episode left me in shock and leaning on the edge of my seat because of the infinite unexpected twists in the story line. Ever since I was younger, I have always enjoyed fantasy stories because I feel they allow me to use my imagination. Thus, the element of fiction and fantasy made the show fun to watch because quite literally anything was possible whether it was witches, ghosts, werewolves, evil doppelgangers, and of course, vampires. However, Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, the creators of this show, made a perfect balance of fantasy and real life which allowed me to connect with the characters more. The characters went on  about their day facing things we all face on a regular day basis like growing up and relationships but also dealing with the crazy supernatural world. The mythical parts of the show mixed with the young love and a lot of drama is simply perfection.

                    <p>
                      The story is set in a town called Mystic Falls that is filled with supernatural history. The main character Elena Gilbert loses her two parents in a mysterious car accident and falls in love with an 162 year old vampire named Stefan that has been looking for her for many years. Their life and relationship become extremely complex when Stefan’s evil brother Damon returns to resurrect their past love Katherine Pierce who is a vampire who happens to look exactly like Elena. Damon and Stefan both fall in love with Elena creating ties with her life and their horrid past. Both brothers attempt to protect Elena as they face villains and enemies that both they and Kathrine have made in their hundreds of years of life. There are also additional storylines revolving around Elena's family and friends. Many people die, turn into vampires, become witches, werewolves, hybrids, and ghosts through a very entertaining and complex storyline. Most importantly, crazy secrets are revealed and it is the perfect supernatural series with an end that puts everything in perspective.

                        <h2 class="text-white mb-3">Why is this Great Television</h2>
                        <p>Great television series lead us to feel invested in the characters' emotions and life because we often find ourselves generating an emotional connection to their fictional world. Have you ever seen a movie, read a book, or watched a show when you end up feeling upset or crying because of the plot? Although the story may not be real, our emotions associated with them very much so are hence, I was an emotional wreck when anything bad happened to Damon, Elena, or Stefan. There is a part of our brains that don't comprehend television is not actually real which is why I, as well as all the other Vampire Diaries fans became so invested. Julie Pleck created a show where we become so emotionally invested in the characters' well being because the amazing writing, visuals, and acting allow the audience to empathize with their situation, understand their pain, and experience the emotional highs and lows with the characters we are emotionally attached to.

                        <p>Overall, The Vampire Diaries was an amazing experience to watch  not only because it was simply entertaining but because I was so infatuated with the unpredictable plot, the characters' families, relationships, drama, and absolutely everything about it. I always say I wish I could watch it for the first time again because of the happiness and excitement it brought me to watch the unhinges and fantastical life of Elana Gilbert. I would one hundred percent recommend you watch this if you haven't already because it is truly my favorite show and always will be.
